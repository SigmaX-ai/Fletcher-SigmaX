# Hardware simulation of Fletcher designs: SodaBeer example

### This example is work-in-progress. Do not expect this to be functional.

This is a slightly more advanced example of how to use **fletchgen** to generate a design based on multiple Arrow Schemas.

The hobbits of Hobbiton and Bywater are about to come together to have a party. 
Given two lists of hobbits (one for those from Hobbiton and the other for those from Bywater), we'd like to generate a list of hobbits that may drink beer (those who have come of age) and a list of hobbits that may drink soda.
