# Introduction
Fletcher currently uses MMIO to pass control information (status, control,
buffer addresses, user arguments, etc...) to the accelerator during run-time.

Several registers are fixed. Other registers are derived from the Arrow schema
and the number of application-specific registers required. All registers are
32-bits. The addressing of the registers shown here is per register, not per
byte as used in for example AXI4-lite. If you are using AXI4-lite you have to
multiply the addresses by 4.

In the following definition read/write access is from the context of the host
system. The Fletcher run-time libraries will set these register automatically on
the host-side during run-time, given a bunch of RecordBatches. See [the run-time
documentation](../runtime/README.md).

Handling of MMIO registers in hardware is done through the
[vhdmmio](https://github.com/abs-tudelft/vhdmmio) tool. `fletchgen` will
automatically run `vhdmmio` for you when it generates an interface. `vhdmmio`
will generate documentation specific to the registers of your design. Once
you've generated a design, check out the `vhdmmio-doc` sub-folder. There will be
an `index.html` that you can open and read.

Below, it will be explained what registers exist in general. Note that for a
specific design, it will be easier to read the documentation that `vhdmmio`
generates.

## Default registers

The default (fixed) registers are as follows.

| Address (decimal) | Name      | Read / Write | Description                                                       |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0                 | control   | Read & Write | Used to signal start, stop, reset, etc. to the accelerator.       |
| 4                 | status    | Read-only    | Used to signal accelerator status to host: idle, busy, done, etc. |
| 8                 | return0   | Read-only    | Return value register 0.                                          |
| 12                | return1   | Read-only    | Return value register 1.                                          |

##### Control register bits
- control(0): start
- control(1): stop
- control(2): reset

##### Status register bits
- status(0): idle
- status(1): busy
- status(2): done

## Schema-derived registers

An Arrow Schema results in a specific in-memory format for an Arrow RecordBatch
(or Arrow Table) consisting of Arrow Arrays (as columns of the tabular
construct). Arrow Arrays of a specific type hold a specific set of Arrow Buffers
that are related through some hierarchy. The specifics of this can be found in
the [Arrow format
specification](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/memory_layout.html).

Fletcher expects the raw data addresses of these Arrow Buffers to be supplied
through MMIO. Therefore, the hierarchy of Arrow Buffers must first be flattened.
This is done according to the currently following order at one level of
hierarchy:

- validity buffer
- offsets buffer
- values buffer
- \<child buffers\>

To flatten any child buffers, a depth-first traversal of the hierarchy is
applied.

The implementation used in both Fletchgen and the C++ run-time library can be
found [here](../common/cpp/include/fletcher/arrow-utils.h).

When the number of RecordBatches used in the accelerator design is N and the
number of Arrow Buffers used in all RecordBatches (either read or write) is M,
the register mapping is defined as follows:

| Address (decimal)    | Name             | Read / Write | Description               |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| 16                   | RB0_FIRSTIDX     | Read & Write | RecordBatch 0 First Index |
| 20                   | RB0_LASTIDX      | Read & Write | RecordBatch 0 Last Index  |
| 24                   | RB1_FIRSTIDX     | Read & Write | RecordBatch 1 First Index |
| 28                   | RB1_LASTIDX      | Read & Write | RecordBatch 1 Last Index  |
| ...                  | ...              | Read & Write | ...                       |
| 16 + 4*2(N-1)        | RB(N-1)_FIRSTIDX | Read & Write | RecordBatch N First Index |
| 16 + 4*(2(N-1) + 1)  | RB(N-1)_LASTIDX  | Read & Write | RecordBatch N Last Index  |

Assuming the number of Arrow Buffers in all used RecordBatches (either read or
write) is N, the register mapping after the default registers will look as
follows:

| Address (decimal)          | Name                    | Read / Write | Description                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 16 + 4 * 2N                | Buffer 0 address low    | Read & Write | Least-significant part of buffer 0 address.   |
| 16 + 4 * (2N + 1)          | Buffer 0 address high   | Read & Write | Most-significant part of buffer 0 address.    |
| 16 + 4 * (2N + 2)          | Buffer 1 address low    | Read & Write | Least-significant part of buffer 1 address.   |
| 16 + 4 * (2N + 3)          | Buffer 2 address high   | Read & Write | Most-significant part of buffer 1 address.    |
| ...                        | ...                     | ...          | ...                                           |
| 16 + 4 * (2N + 2(M-1))     | Buffer M-1 address low  | Write-only   | Least-significant part of buffer M-1 address. |
| 16 + 4 * (2N + 2(M-1) + 1) | Buffer M-1 address high | Write-only   | Most-significant part of buffer M-1 address.  |

## Custom registers

Through Fletchgen a user may request more custom registers to be mapped to be
used for their kernel implementation. This is done using the `--reg` flag,
following a space-seperated list of strings of the following format:

```<behavior>:<width>:<name>:<init>```

Where:
* `<width>` is the bit-width of the register.
* `<behavior>` is one character from the following options:
  * `c` : (control) register content is controlled by host-side software.
  * `s` : (status) register content is set by the hardware kernel, and sent to
          the host as status information.
* `<name>` is the name of the register.
* `<init>` is optional, and can be used to automatically write to the register
           in the initialization during simulation. 
           Init must be a hexadecimal value in the form of 0x01234ABCD.

The first custom kernel register will appear at the next free multiple-of-4
address, after the schema-derived registers. Any next custom kernel register
address will be the next free multiple-of-4 address, after the previous custom
register. The address space used is always rounded up to a multiple of 4 bytes,
and depends on the bit-width of the register.

Suppose the next free address after the schema-derived registers is `C`, then
the register map of custom registers supplied through `fletchgen` using `--reg
c:16:cat s:64:dog s:32:fish` is:

| Address (decimal) | Name     | Read/Write   | Description                                         |
|-------------------|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| C                 | cat      | Read & Write | Custom register 0 (taking 4 bytes of address space) |
| C + 4             | dog      | Read-only    | Custom register 1 (taking 8 bytes of address space) |
| C + 12            | fish     | Read-only    | Custom register 2 (taking 4 bytes of address space) |
| ...               | ...      | ...          | ...                                                 |

## Profiling registers
Through Fletchgen (through meta data supplied with schema fields) it is possible
to profile streams to the kernel. The Arrow field should be supplied with the
key-value pair metadata: `{"fletcher_profile", "true"}`. The profiling registers
are inserted at the next free multiple-of-4 address after the custom registers.
Suppose the next free multiple-of-4 address after the custom registers is P,
then the register map will look as follows:

| Address (decimal) | Name                    | Read/Write   | Description                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| P                 | Profile_enable          | Read & Write | Setting '1' to bit 0 enables the profiling components.        |
| P + 4             | Profile_clear           | Read & Write | Writing '1' to bit 0 clears the profiling component counters. |
| P + 8             | `<R>_<F>_<I>_elements`  | Read-only    | Number of elements transferred.                               |
| P + 12            | `<R>_<F>_<I>_valids`    | Read-only    | Number of cycles stream was valid.                            |
| P + 16            | `<R>_<F>_<I>_readies`   | Read-only    | Number of cycles stream was ready.                            |
| P + 20            | `<R>_<F>_<I>_transfers` | Read-only    | Number of cycles stream was handshaked.                       |
| P + 24            | `<R>_<F>_<I>_packets`   | Read-only    | Number of handshaked `last` signals.                          |
| P + 28            | `<R>_<F>_<I>_cycles`    | Read-only    | Number of cycles profiler was enabled.                        |
| ...               | ...                     | ...          | ...                                                           |

Where:
* `<R>`: RecordBatch name.
* `<F>`: Field name.
* `<I>`: Stream index. Arrow types can generate multiple streams per field, so 
         this is the flattened index of the stream. For example, for the `utf8` 
         type of Arrow, the first stream is the length stream (index 0) and the 
         second stream is the values stream (index 1).
